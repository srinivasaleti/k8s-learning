## What is an Ingress Controller?
- An **Ingress Controller** is a Kubernetes component responsible for managing access to services within a cluster.
- It processes **Ingress resources** defined in Kubernetes, which specify rules for routing external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the appropriate services.

## Why Do We Need an Ingress Controller?
- Without an Ingress Controller, you would rely on services like **NodePort** or **LoadBalancer**, which require a separate load balancer for each service.
- Reduces the need for multiple cloud load balancers, lowering costs.
- Handles SSL termination, reducing the burden on individual services.
- Can integrate with security features like WAF (Web Application Firewall).
- Allows scaling of services independently while still ensuring proper traffic routing.

## Popular Ingress Controllers
- **NGINX Ingress Controller**: Widely used, offers robust features for traffic management.
- **Traefik**: Lightweight and dynamic, good for microservices and edge routing.
- **HAProxy Ingress**: Focused on high performance and advanced features.
- **Istio Gateway**: For use with service meshes.
- **AWS ALB Ingress Controller**: Integrates with AWS Application Load Balancer.

## How It Works
1. The **Ingress resource** defines rules for routing traffic (e.g., domains, paths, TLS).
2. The **Ingress Controller** monitors the cluster for Ingress resources and configures its underlying proxy (like NGINX) accordingly.
3. Incoming requests are routed to the appropriate service/pod based on the rules.
